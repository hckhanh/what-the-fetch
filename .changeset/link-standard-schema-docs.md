Link "Standard Schema" references to https://standardschema.dev in documentation

Updated all unlinked "Standard Schema" text throughout documentation files (README.md, docs/content/docs/index.mdx, docs/content/docs/getting-started.mdx, and docs/content/docs/api-reference.mdx) to include hyperlinks to https://standardschema.dev, providing readers direct access to the specification.
